            CT horror Bears hasn't always been what it is today for it all started because of a simple university art
            class. The project was a soft sculpture to create something out of fabric and bring meaning to its seems
            easy enough. So began the start of a sculpture named Childhood Trauma.
            The original explanation of the piece is a complete 180 of what the company has become today because it
            didn't start as something that isn't bad here's how it began;
            I chose to make the bear like this because it no longer looks lovable and it no longer became a child's toy
            but a different creature altogether. It shows pain and torture as well as addiction and self hatred and yet
            there a level of care in all of it making everything i did to the bear demonstrate different traumas making
            it truly unloveable.
            Now we believe that the bears aren't something that's unloveable but instead a creature to love
            unconditionally because they will always endure the pain of your childhood trauma to protect you.

                Teds Beginning
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Teddsworth actually started as a dumb little doodle i made in my memes class yes i said that correctly i had
            a class called memes. But he started as a drawing on a paper, a concept like chucky to be every child's best
            friend. So when my teacher introduced making a soft sculpture i jumped on the idea of making a horror bear i
            was calling fluffy at the start. I went out to the thrift store to find the perfect bear. I wanted it to be
            a toy that a child would have loved before being thrown away. That's when I found the perfect adorable
            fluffy brown bear. I brought that bear to school the next day to tell and ask if I could do what I planned
            for the project and the teacher told me that my idea would look like a fresh fresh bear from five nights at
            Freddy's. I was determined to prove her wrong. One of my best friends named Brock was the person who looked
            at “fluffy” and said that his name is Dodsworth and not fluffy because he was a teddy bear and it just made
            sense and so Teddsworth was born. I sat down and for three days i made him well watching a horror tv show.i
            took a regular stuffed bear and made him almost monstris. I used clay for the ribcage as well as for the
            lower and the upper jaw. I then used a piece of a halloween mask for his exposed skull. Then i used a
            skeletons bones as well as hand from another decoration and tore claws off of a necklace and inserted it
            into his body. I also cut into the bear and poorly stitched it up using a thick black thread. I used the
            same black thread to form the eye socket then i put another button for the other eye. I then up a syringe in
            his leg and a ribbon to tie it off. The second last step of the entire work was adding the red and for this
            i did actually use fake blood and i did two different coats with two different consistencies to emphasis the
            blood. The final step was the noose to hang the bear with a hemp rope. I brought Ted to school and I'd place
            him in spots at school and walk away with him in few because I wanted to be able to see people's reactions
            to it. Some people did not like him, others wanted pictures with him. For the class I hung him and showed my
            sculpture and that teacher only remembers me from that project. When I last saw her she looked at me and
            said and I quote… “you made that bear.” To this day Teddsworth still hangs in my bedroom right at the foot
            of my bed.
