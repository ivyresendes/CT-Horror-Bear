                Our company's objective is to sell our bears to you as a symbol that it's ok not to be ok. That you can
                be
                scary and strong no matter what you've been through in life and no matter what your childhood might have
                been like. If our bears still live even if broken and creepy then why can't you. Don't be scared to be
                yourself any longer.

                Ivy Resendes is the creator of not just the original art piece but of the company CT horror Bears. Yes
                it
                started as a silly art project but after careful consideration and a lot of people telling me to sell
                them I
                finally decided to make a website to show them off. Being born in ontario and growing up in a small town
                alberta. Being a product of a broken family my life wasn't easy. I was always called the black sheep
                growing
                up and i always thought that was a bad thing because villains are black sheeps or so i thought. When I
                got
                older I realised that it shouldn't matter: who decided what was a black sheep or who was a villain and
                who
                is just a misunderstood hero? Who says what's bad? why does trauma have to define me is being different
                really that big of a deal. I love scary things and with my own lore and trauma. I like making them. It's
                my
                weird messed up therapy. There's nothing wrong with who you are and that's a big part of my bearings.
                Scary
                or not they are strong and courageous they don't need to put on a mask so why should you?
