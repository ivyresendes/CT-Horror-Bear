                Almost every child is said to have grown up with a toy that became their comfort, the thing they could
                love
                and cherish and ultimately feel safe with. Be it a doll,car, figurine or even a doily looking blanket.
                I'd
                say that the favourite among most children above all else is a stuffed animal or more specifically the
                good
                old fashioned stuffed bear.
                What would happen if the child never felt safe even with a teddy bear as their comfort? It means that
                the
                child had to grow up too fast, and that now they will never be able to truly feel safe. Childhood trauma
                will never fully heal. In the case when the child experiences this trauma I believe so does that bear,
                so if
                the childs abused, neglected or even assaulted or used the bear will become what it needs to be, to
                protect
                that kid, their kid that they help comfort.
                It may look creepy and scary in the end but so would you if you were faced to protect a child who never
                grew
                out of being scared of what might be in the dark.

                Scary can be cute
            </h2>

        <p>
            Who says scary things can't be cute in the first place anyways? I think that creepy and scary is just
            something that not everyone can truly appreciate. Almost in the same way not everyone can enjoy a horror
            movie or a haunted house. When you've met scarier things in the real world horror becomes comforting because
            maybe just maybe you're not alone. Most people would say that children are cute and yet they use kids to be
            creepy and scary in movies so then it's all a matter of perspective.

                Reason why

            <p>
                I've had alot of people over the years question me on why I do what I do and all I can say to that
                question
                is that I know it's the right thing to do in a messed up way. Not everything can be sunshine and
                rainbows
                all the time, sometimes you have to be okay with not being okay with being a little weird a little
                creepy
                and still having the strength to keep going to take your trauma and still live and i believe that my
                bears
                can prove that even if it's a little dark and scary you can be loved and you can feel safe and that you
                will
                be protected by a bear who's gone through as much as you have in your life. I wanted people not to feel
                alone in this world. It's okay to be the black sheep to stick out and stand out for better or for worse.
                That is you are so creepy , be scary and never forget that your trauma may have hurt you but it's also
                made
                you stronger in the most messed up way it's helped make you who you are. So now I'll ask you a question
                in
                return: if you could help people by doing what I do , would you?
