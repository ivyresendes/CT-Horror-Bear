                    Teddsworth is a bear who's definitely seen better days with his broken open skull and exposed rib
                    cage. He's
                    zombie-like. He's missing his one foot and his hand looks like it's been put in acid only having
                    bone
                    remain.teddsworth has claws ready to fight and an open jaw showing his fangs. There's a knife coming
                    out of
                    the back of his head and a needle in his foot from harowin.hes got one button eye and his other is
                    coming
                    right out of the socket. Teddsworth is hung from a noose and sure he may look scary but I will never
                    stop
                    loving my first child who represents PTSD. Are you brave enough to let him stay with you?

                    The twin is a bear… bears who were sown together to be one. Their eyes match to create one pair on
                    both
                    heads, the other being a light or button. Pins and jabbed into them like a voodoo doll and if you
                    hold them
                    tight you can feel a heartbeat inside. They have teeth within their jaws looking almost human-like
                    and
                    forced, giving them a type of monstrous smile. This bear represents bipolar with its two heads, a
                    product
                    only few can love. Will you be the one to take them home?

                Bear concept
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            The bear's concept is to show people it's ok to be a little scary. That's ok… I wanna show everyone that
            you're not defined by your past. That it's ok not to be ok. It's ok to have trauma and to have mental
            illness it doesn't make you broken or different or a freak it makes you stronger. Each bear shows trauma and
            a kind of mental illness; Teddsworth repersents a type of ptsd to never forget the pain you went through and
            the twin represents bipolar disorder to continuously be switching feeling a little two headed. In the future
            I want to make more bears to show almost every mental illness. I want people to know it's okay to be a
            little broken because life isn't perfect so why are you forced to be?
